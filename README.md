# pageobject-maven-webdriver-junit
Simple example that demonstrates pageobjects, maven, webdriver and junit, java against a test system


Background  
This project contains a very simple structure that should demonstrate the concepts behind pageobjects

Notes  
1. I have used Ecipse IDE (Luna) with JDK 1.8 and jUnit plugin ( comes as standard )  
2. To run a test, you will need to right click the jUnit test and "run" as a Junit Test( this may need configuration)    
3. I will add some screenshots  
4. The maven pom file has the webdriver and junit dependencies  
5. This example does not run via the command line using say ANT ( I will add this in later)
